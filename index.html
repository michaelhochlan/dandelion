        <h1>Why Dandelions?</h1>

        <div class="text">
            Dandelion recipes keep things wild in the kitchen in early spring, 
            and there’s nothing like bright fresh blossoms and zesty wild greens 
            after a long winter of heavy food. Dandelions are exciting to backyard 
            foragers because they’re one of the easiest wild plants to safely identify.  
            Though they do have a few look likes (coltsfoot in the very early spring and hawks eye in the fall), 
            most children know how to spot dandelion plants with ease.
            Every part of a dandelion is edible, from the roots to the leaves and flowers, 
            even the unopened flower buds and flower stalks. 
            There are literally hundreds of dandelion recipes that offer creative ideas for 
            using every part of the plant, both for food and medicine. 
            That’s right, dandelions are more than just edible!  
            They’re also great as a spring medicine, providing much-needed bitters to help cleanse 
            the system in anticipation of warmer weather.  
            They can be made into all manner of tinctures, teas, salves, and soaps.
